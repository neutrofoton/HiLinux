# SSH Key

1. Generate SSH Key

    ```bash
    # location public and private RSA key generated.
    # default name will be id_rsa (private), id_rsa.pub (public)

    ls -l ~/.ssh

    # generate ssh key
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    ```

2. Copy ssh key (public) to remote server

    ```bash
    # ssh-copy-id {user}@{ip/host}
    ssh-copy-id root@192.168.1.1
    ```

    The public key will be copied/added to the server (192.168.1.1) at <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>

3. Connect to remote server via SSH. You should be auto login to the user(root) home.
    ```bash
    ssh root@192.168.1.1
    ```
